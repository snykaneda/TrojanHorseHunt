Dataset Description
Clean Model
The clean_model folder contains the baseline NHiTS Model [1] (PyTorch format) trained exclusively on unpoisoned ESA-AD [2] Mission 1 telemetry (channels 44, 45, 46). It serve as the reference model before any adversarial manipulation. It is also available in the Models tab.
The model was trained using the same pipeline as detailed in the Train Clean Model Notebook.

Models with trojans
The poisoned_models folder contains poisoned NHITS models [1] (PyTorch format) in which triggers should be discovered. The same models are available in the Models tab.

Baseline training dataset
The clean_train_data.csv file contains several years of real sensor measurements from 3 channels (channel_44, channel_45, and channel_46) of a large spacecraft operated by the European Space Agency. This file was used to train the clean baseline model according to the procedures given in the Clean Model Training notebook.

Clean_train_data.csv is a resampled ESA-Mission1 data of the ESA-AD dataset [2].

Sample submission
The sample_submission.csv file is a sample submission file in the correct format.
