Trigger Matrix Construction
This notebook builds a zero‐filled trigger matrix for the 45 poisoned models across three channels:

Configuration Parameters

N_SAMPLES = 75 — length of each trigger segment
N_MODELS  = 45 — how many (poisoned) models we’ll test
CHANNELS  = ['channel_44', 'channel_45', 'channel_46'] 🛰️ — the three monitored channels
Zero Trigger Vector

We create a flat vector of zeros with length 75 samples × 3 channels = 225
This represents “no trigger” by default (all values = 0)
Trigger DataFrame

Rows: one per model (N_MODELS = 45)
Columns:
model_id (1–45) 🚩 inserted as the first column
channel_44_1, channel_44_2, …, channel_44_75, channel_45_1, …, channel_46_75 🔠 generated via a nested list comprehension
Index shifted to start at 1 for human-friendly referencing
Preview

df.head() displays the first 5 rows so you can confirm:
| model_id | channel_44_1 | … | channel_46_75 |
|:--------:|:------------:|:-:|:-------------:|
| 1 | 0.0 | … | 0.0 |
| 2 | 0.0 | … | 0.0 |
| … | … | … | … |
🎯 Why this matters:
Having a clean, zero‐trigger baseline lets us inject custom spike patterns later and measure each model’s sensitivity—one row per model, one column per time‐step per channel. This structured setup is key for systematic trigger discovery and vulnerability analysis. 🕵️‍♀️
